    <h1>Lux Health for Patients</h1>
    <p>Lux Health is founded and built by health care providers who see a vision for better and more convenient care at lower prices, using technology.</p>

    <p>After working at world-class institutions, including Stanford Health Care and Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Clinic, our founding team saw opportunities to serve the best of U.S. care to everyone.</p>

    <p>Though telehealth and telemedicine can reduce the burden on hospitals for basic issues, they cannot match the quality of in-person, human care of trained providers.  The power of being present, in-person with a caregiver cannot be so easily replaced.</p>

    <p>Lux Health uses the latest technology to bring quality care back to the home.  No longer will you have to wait an hour at the clinic for your physical exam.  We will meet you when and where it is most convenient for you.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">We are health care delivered.</p>
