    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Thank you all for your support and desire to use our services</h3>
    <p>We appreciate your active effort to prevent disease and keep you and your family healthy with Lux Health.  We absolutely understand your desire for at-home care.  However, in times like these, we are not technologists or business people.</p>
    <p>We are, first and foremost, health care providers.  We believe we have a greater duty to temporarily reorient our time and service of healing in these trying times.  In light of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19),
    <strong>we will not be scheduling any more appointments at this time</strong>.  We will temporarily not be available to answer our phones.</p>
    <p>Do not catastrophize.  This is an opportunity for us as a community to rise up to the challenge and act with our resilience and compassion.</p>
    <p>We look forward to serving you again following this challenge.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;">The Lux Health Team</p>
